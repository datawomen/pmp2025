•	Processed all CVA districts through the updated PS tool
5/5 - 5/9
•	Delivered AO precision recommendations to Ops with treatment acre summaries by district and stand and appended recommendations to the STL Precision Silviculture Map 1.
•	Built waterfall charts for Cossatot, Kiamichi, and combined AO to visualize acreage drop-offs from StandAvg to final precision selections at Julio's request 2.
•	Reached out to Ben Kobek to align on CVA Precision Silviculture rollout and confirmed preferred operational filters (25-acre minimum per stand) 3.
•	Multiple working sessions with Erik to review CVA imagery and validate the updated notebook structure for multi-district deployment in NC & SC 4.
•	Processed all CVA districts through the updated PS tool 5.
•	Cleaned and standardized the Evergreen Detection dataset and engineered predictive features using pre-assessment winter LAI temporal data plus stand attributes (e.g. BA, TPA, SI), for Gradient Boosting and RF classification 6.
•	Continued development of Precision Silviculture Map workflow guide with GIS walkthroughs and visual interpretation scenarios for stand selection 7.
5/12 - 5/16
•	Completed making revisions to the Natural Pine Blue work plan and shared with Matt 8.
•	Talked with Jenny about using the Brown Spot Detection Model for the Brown Spot burning project 9.
•	Met with Ryan to discuss utilizing new spore load data to feed into/further train the Brown's spot detection model and also pushed for the hyperspectral UAV to be brought down for this purpose (and for other use cases) 10.
•	Updated the STL Precision Silviculture layer with NLAR recommendations and shared the list of recommendations with acreage breakdown with operations 11.
•	Met with Zack to review the Evergreen data from Steve Lowrimore that he had compiled alongside SMG type, assessed predictive power of SMG type alone, and discussed next steps for building a random forest model for Evergreen detection 12.
•	Post-processed precision recommendations for AO, and shared final shapefiles with Erik for QAQC 13.
•	Aggregated AO precision treatment acres and LAI values to the stand level and exported excel file with recommendations and acreage breakdowns 14.

•	Call with Tom Garris where he walked me through the end-to-end workflow from exporting precision polygons, to importing them to FMS, and generating maps and CWS reports 17.
•	Had a call with the NLAR silviculture team to review STL Precision Silviculture webGIS functionality, including editing polygons, exporting them, and prioritizing treatment areas 18.
•	Debriefed with Steve and Zack after meeting with NLAR silviculture team and discussed standardizing interpretation of precision and stand average recommendations and next steps to develop a guide with example scenarios to support consistent decision-making also planned for the continuation of weekly calls with the corresponding regions silviculture team to work through the webGIS workflow the week they get their precision recommendations 
•	Met with Greg Dunnigan to troubleshoot acreage discrepancies when exporting and processing treatment polygons in webGIS. Identified that differences in projection (UTM zones) and area calculation methods (geodesic vs. standard) were causing inconsistencies 20.
•	Met with Tom to talk about migration to ArcGis Pro.  offered to help automated his workflow for assessing multispectral imagery for the nursery.  
5/26 - 5/30
•	Meeting with Zack to go over the EG grade data from Steve Lowrimore in FL for 2018-2024 (the map of stands by year and SMG). Set the next steps to link the LAI from this time frame to each stand to look for trends in LAI in relation to EG grade data. Also need to link Julio in to look at the competing vegetation assessment of Winter LAI vs Winter-Spring difference 
•	Meeting with Greg Dunnigan and Zack to go over the mobile functionality treatment area shapefile export process 
•	Debrief meeting with Zack and Steve to discuss takeaways and plan for demos with each region's precision silv output releases
•	
•	Developed a guide on how to edit and export precision recommendations using the STL Summary Web App.
•	Created an acre reconciliation excel file that allows foresters to get the updated acreage from their updated shape_areas exported for their precision treatments
•	Went to the DeQueen office and held a hands-on walkthrough of the Precision Silviculture workflow with the AO silviculture team at the request of Kelly Kemp
•	Reached out to Tara Dickson to propose the future integration of precision spatial data directly into FMS in so that foresters can track where precision treatments are planned/prescribed within each stand, without needing to split them.
•	Delivered CVA recommendations to Ben Kobek
•	Held a call with Benjamin Kobek to review CVA precision silviculture tool outputs. Discussed regional budget constraints ($643k reduction for CVA) and their decision to eliminate VA comp control for this year. 
•	Met with David Wall (silv forester) to troubleshoot an issue related to exporting precision treatments
•	Met with Curtis Daugherty (silv forester) to discuss how to select full-stand recommendations when precision treatments are not approptiae go over how to select full stand recommendations for export when precision treatments don’t make sense
•	Met with Greg Dunnigan to address potential ongoing issues with exporting precision treatments. Identified the need for clarity on exporting as tabular and proposed adding functionality to buffer precision/full-stand treatments before export.
•	Sent Greg Dunnigan a foresters guide I created on how to export and edit precision polygons for his review/edits. Also, provided Greg with detailed plans (User Interface and backend workflow) for incorporating 2025 buffer guidelines into buffer functionality and a final clip to stand boundaries to ensure treatments are ready for treatment following export.
•	Processed all MSLA districts through the precision silviculture tool. Identified an issue excluding 40-50 stands being excluded per district and reached out to Erik. This was traced to mixed imagery sources (Landsat for Spring vs. Sentinel-2 for winter. Erik resampled the Spring imagery to 20m resolution, and then I reprocessed all MSLA districts.
•	Worked on PMP mid-year updates.
